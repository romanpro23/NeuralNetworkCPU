Some GPU support files have been taken from https://github.com/tberg12/murphy which are distributed apparently under the Apache-2.0 license

For GPU support, you will need to install the Nvidia CUDA Toolkit.

I am currently using v8.0. May require visual c++ 2015 compiler. There are ways around the need to install the compiler in newer versions.
